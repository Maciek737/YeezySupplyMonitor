# YeezySupplyMonitor

Hello Welcome to Lil Chuks Yeezy Supply Monitor. 

This is just some example code to show off my skillsets.

The code has A LOT of comments and should be really simple to understand.

To get started just clone the repo and then in terminal do node main.js

It will ask you for the SKU of the product to monitor. The SKU can be found in the URL of the product on Yeezy Supply. 

Ex. https://www.yeezysupply.com/product/FY3729 
the SKU is FY3729

Donâ€™t steal my code, I can run the monitor for you for free on any drop just message me on discord Lil Chuk#0001
